## Legacy Website

This is the original version of my personal website. 

If you want to see my new one, go [here](github.com/cortanium/cortanium.github.io)!


Everything here is as mostly unchanged as when I first programmed it. 
One exception- to make things neater in index.html, I moved <style> code to separate .css file.

This website includes..

  - A side image that transforms to a center image on mobile

  - Social link integration buttons

  - A big name, and a big subtext.

## Revision (Planned)   https://github.com/Cortanium/legacywebsite.v2

  - Better code! More formatting.

  - Excision of large parts of the website data. I can do twice as much with half as much.

  - CDN provided CSS, JS, and fonts

Goal: No visual changes, just a smaller, more optimized, and better internally designed website.
